# A dark Wordpress Theme for showing pictures on BigScreen

This is an old Wordpress theme I did for my portfolio a long time ago. I don't use it anymore because its User Interface is not the best way to present my work.
I started working on it with the Automattic's [Underscores](https://underscores.me/) Template.
